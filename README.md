# UI-UX-Experiment2

## Aim:
To Design a Basic Mobile and Web Layout for an Existing Case Study

## Algorithm:
~~~
- Select a Case Study: Choose an existing product or website for reference.
- Identify User Needs: Determine target audience and key features required.
- Sketch Wireframe: Create a rough layout for mobile and web screens.
- Define UI Elements: Buttons, menus, navigation bars, icons, typography, and colors.
- Optimize for Mobile & Web: Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes.
- Prototype Using Tools: Use Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch to build an interactive design.
- Test & Improve: Conduct usability testing, gather feedback, and refine the layout

 LAB EXPERIMENT – 2
1. Gestalt Principles in Mobile & Web Layouts
 Proximity: Group related elements together to help users quickly understand relationships.
 Similarity: Use consistent colors, fonts, and UI patterns for a cohesive look.
 Closure: Create recognizable shapes from negative space to guide attention.
 Continuation: Align elements in a logical flow for smooth navigation.
 Figure-Ground: Use contrast to highlight key components.
2. UI Elements & Design Patterns
 Navigation: Sticky menus for mobile, mega menus for desktops.
 Buttons: Clearly labeled CTAs with appropriate size and color contrast.
 Forms: Minimalistic design with autofill and clear error messages.
 Cards: Group content in visually appealing sections for better readability.
3. Interaction Behaviors & Usability Principles
 Ensure touch targets are large enough on mobile.
 Maintain visual hierarchy for ease of scanning.
 Feedback mechanisms, like hover eƯects and loading indicators, improve usability.
 Responsive design principles to ensure accessibility on diƯerent screen sizes.
4. Brand Logo Creation with Canva
 Follow a color palette that resonates with the brand identity.
 Choose a font that reflects the brand tone (modern, professional, playful).
 Maintain simplicity for scalability across devices.
 Export in various formats (SVG, PNG) for multiple use cases.
